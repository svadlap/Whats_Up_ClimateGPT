# Whats-Up-ClimateGPT

This repository is part of the DAEN 690 Capstone Project at the College of Engineering, Fall 2024. The project focuses on improving the performance of ClimateGPT, an open-source AI model developed by Erasmus.AI in collaboration with the Club of Rome Climate. ClimateGPT is designed to assist researchers, policymakers, and business leaders in making informed decisions about climate change mitigation and adaptation.

# Key Features
AI Classifier Development: A sophisticated AI classifier to accurately parse user queries into core model responses or ancillary database responses. <br>
Structured Query Framework: A robust framework for querying multiple climate-related databases (NOAA, NASA, IPCC, etc.) using structured SQL queries via APIs. <br>
Multi-Modal Response Generation: Supports rich, multi-modal outputs, including text, data visualizations, and references, tailored for complex climate scenarios. <br>
Open-Source and Scalable: Built on open-source technologies with scalability in mind, ensuring accessibility and continuous improvement. <br>

# Goals
Improve Query Classification: Enhance the AI’s ability to distinguish between queries handled by the ClimateGPT model and those requiring external database information. <br>
Integrate External Databases: Connect and query key climate databases for comprehensive, data-driven insights. <br>
Optimize Response Formats: Develop effective prompt engineering strategies to generate user-friendly outputs. <br>
Enable Rich, Multi-Modal Outputs: Provide detailed and contextually relevant responses across different media formats. <br>

# Technologies
AWS: EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda for compute, storage, and database management. <br>
Natural Language Processing (NLP): For AI classifier and query parsing. <br>
Generative AI: For ClimateGPT’s foundational model and response generation. <br>
MLOps: Ensuring seamless deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement. <br>
